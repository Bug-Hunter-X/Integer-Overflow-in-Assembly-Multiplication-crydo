# Integer Overflow Bug in x86 Assembly

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in x86 assembly code: an integer overflow during multiplication.  The code performs a series of arithmetic operations, including a multiplication that can result in an overflow if the operands are sufficiently large.  The solution demonstrates how to address this using appropriate checks and potentially larger integer types.

## Bug Description:
The assembly code performs multiplication of two 32-bit integers.  If the product exceeds the maximum value representable by a signed 32-bit integer, an overflow occurs, leading to an incorrect result. This is a subtle error that can be difficult to detect without careful testing or static analysis.

## Solution:
The solution addresses the integer overflow issue by checking the operands before multiplication. If an overflow is detected, an error code is returned. Alternatively, using 64-bit integers can prevent overflow for a broader range of inputs.
